    " * Access the Official Course Materials from PL-App\n",
    " * Create a new Visual Programming application\n",
    " * Create a Python Script using Blockly\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background / Scenario\n",
    "The syntax of programming can sometimes get in the way of the logic. Blockly provides a graphical way for programs to be developed without having to worry about the details of a particular language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Resources\n",
    " * PC with Internet Access\n",
    " * Ethernet based connection to the Internet with DHCP and no traffic filtering\n",
    " * Raspberry Pi that is configured and imaged for PL-App access"
