    "### Objectives\n",
    " * Part 1: Accessing the Shell Interface using PL-App\n",
    "    * Access the Official Course Materials from PL-App\n",
    "    * Connect to the Linux Shell using PL-App\n",
    " * Part 2: Explore the Shell Interface and Commands\n",
    "    * Discover basic file and directory commands\n",
    "    * Getting help\n",
    "    * Monitoring system processes\n",
    "    * Managing processes\n",
    "    * Determine basic network information\n",
    "    * Setting file permissions\n",
    "    * Display memory, disk usage information and system shutdown\n",
    "    * Perform basic package management\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background \n",
    "Linux is an open source operating system that runs on various devices from thermostats and smartphones to big data server farms. Numerous integrated libraries are available that provide a very stable, fast, secure, scalable, and customizable environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Linux distribution is an operating system built around the Linux kernel. The main difference between different distributions is the directory structure, commands available, and the package manager. The package manager is used to install new software from the distribution repositories. The Raspberry Pi board usually runs a Linux distribution called Raspbian as the operating system. Raspbian is based on a very popular Debian Linux distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with any other operating system, Raspbian allows you to control the board via a Shell Command Line Interface (CLI) using standard Linux commands. Although this sounds intimidating, especially today when the Graphical User Interface (GUI) makes everything intuitive and extremely easy, the command line still remains a very powerful tool for advanced operations.\n",
    "This lab will allow you to experiment with some of the basic CLI commands available on most Linux distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Resources \n",
    " * PC with Internet Access\n",
    " * Raspberry Pi with power cable and either a wired or wireless network connection\n",
    " * Raspberry Pi that is configured and imaged for PL-App access"
