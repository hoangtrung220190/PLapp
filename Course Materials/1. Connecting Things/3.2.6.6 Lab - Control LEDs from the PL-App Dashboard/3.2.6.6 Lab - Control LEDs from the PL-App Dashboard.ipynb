    "PL-App provides an web based interactive notebook interface, which can contain not only relatime graphs to visualize measured data in form of a chart, but also interactive widgets that can provide control using interactive checkboxes and sliders. The interactive widgets can be used to turn on or off, or change the behavior of components connected to the Raspberry Pi or Arduino.\n",

    "In this lab, the interactive PL-App notebook with interactive widgets will be used to control the LEDs connected to the GPIO pins of an Arduino. The PWM (Pulse Wave Modulation) signal will be used to dim the LEDs.\n",

    "### Required Resources \n",
    " * PC with Internet Access\n",
    " * Ethernet based connection to the Internet with DHCP and no traffic filtering\n",
    " * Raspberry Pi that is configured and imaged for PL-App access\n",
    " * RedBoard or compatible\n",
